## TODO (major)
 - [ ] Transliteration
 - [ ] dagre rewrite (sideways, specify exact layer). KEY: "position: function (node: any) { }, // returns { row, col } for element"
 - [ ] inh, der, cog correct chaining (!!)
 - [ ] Compound nodes, a la https://js.cytoscape.org/demos/compound-nodes/
 - [ ] Modules, Requirejs
 - [ ] option for reworked tiering system that only on basis of languages 
 - [ ] Instead of a tree view, have a linear view: a much simpler display of word relations especially for something linear like Spanish -> English (also, a UI to indicate this type of search: from one language to another)
 - [ ] Stop the relayouting from jumping so much
 - [ ] Move templating logic to wtf_plugin_wiktionary via the system. Then submit a PR
## TODO (minor)
 - [X] Capture downwards vs capture upwards
 - [ ] Easy way to cache a given SAMPLE request
 - [ ] Support other language wiktionaries, not just english
 - [ ] Sometimes, templates like {{la-verb}} that indicate a non-lemma form contains hard-to-process output like {{la-verb|1+.p3inf.poet-sync-perf|negō}}
 - [ ] Allowance to manually add in a custom edge.
 - [x] Save graphs via list of nodes which can be included in the url (as a parse string) for easy access
 - [x] When multiple etymologies are found, display them all at the same time (Fix conenction when crossing between different numbered etymologies)
 - [ ] multiple definitions need multiple distinct nodes?
 - [ ] iframe in the wiktionary entry
 - [ ] unabbreviate the edge labels
 - [ ] button to automatically click nodes
 - [ ] undo button
 - [ ] audience: etymology, foreign language learners
 - [ ] macron
 - [x] !! SHARE BUTTON! (kinda)
 - [ ] !! RANDOM BUTTON! https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Random_page
 - [ ] "Don't show again" tour dialog box
 - [ ] {{see desc}} indicates many more descendants
 - [X] different colors for up/down
 - [ ] Instead of showing raw templates, show an interpreted version (with the name of language nad word) with the full template info revealed on hover
 - [ ] Remove all not containing relevant languages button (all languages before opening descendants )
